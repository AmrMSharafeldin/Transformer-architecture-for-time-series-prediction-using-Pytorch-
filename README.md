 # **Introduction:**
 **Overview**
Predicting stock market behavior represents a serious challenge for financial analysts due to the random nature of stock market features. These features are often unpredictable and difficult to generalize, making accurate modeling of stock market behavior an extremely difficult problem.

The category under which this problem lies is referred to as technical analysis, which involves the interpretation of price actions in the stock market. This type of analysis focuses primarily on determining the likelihood of a trend continuing or reversing. Technical analysis aims to reflect all available information that could affect the behavior of the trend and assumes that prices tend to follow the same past tendencies. 

**Deep Learning perspective**
the technical analysis of stock markets can be seen as a time series problem, where, given a sequence of observations, we aim to predict a fixed-size window of future behaviors based on the trend. A simple solver for this problem can be thought of as computing the linear combination of the input sequence, where a coefficient factor determines the impact of previous time spots at each period. An improved predictor can be constructed by optimizing the predictions of our current model, turning it into an optimization problem on time series data, which is very appropriate for modern deep-learning solvers.

The prediction of our autoregression model can be expressed as:
**p = β₁ * yₜ₋₁ + β₂ * yₜ₋₂ + β₃ * yₜ₋₃ + … + βₖ * yₜ₋ₖ**
Where:
- **p**: the predicted value.
- **yₜ₋ᵢ**: the value of the time series at the previous time step 𝑡−𝑖.
- **βᵢ**: the coefficient representing the weight of each time step's contribution.



# **Architecture**

The proposed architecture is a hybrid of an encoder block adapted from transformers and 1D convolution layers. 
Encoder Layer:
The Core of the network is an encoder block that is primarily composed of a multi-head self-attention layer followed by 2 convolution layers. The multi-head layer is designed to create a contextually aware vector of shape (sequence_lenght, num_afeatures) for each sentence. Then Conv1D increases the dimensionality of the num_features to detect more complex features of the contextual aware vector. Normalization, dropouts, and residual connect layers are added to retain the stability of the backpropagation 
Transformers:
The transformer block stacks N encoder blocks to obtain contextual awareness from higher to lower features. Then the outputs of this operation through map layers to increase the learnability of the model and also to match the outputs to the desired output shape (examples, output sequence length) 

It’s important to note that the input and ground truth sequences are normalized before feedforward. Then the inverse transformation is applied to the predictions for plotting and computing the Relative error, to be later used in Model Performance Comparison. Also do to excessive ram usage by the model. It wasn’t possible to run feedforward on the full test data locally, Thus  the analysis.csv for this model was computed using Google Collab
